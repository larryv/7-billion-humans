# *7 Billion Humans* solutions

[*7 Billion Humans*][7BH] is a 2018 puzzle video game designed around
a [concurrent][CONC] [visual programming language][VPL].  Dissatisfied
by the game's limit of three programs per level but excited by its
ability to export plain text, I have put my solutions into version
control, which is absolutely a normal thing to do.
