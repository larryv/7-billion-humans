# *7 Billion Humans* solutions

[*7 Billion Humans*][7BH] is a puzzle game by [Tomorrow Corporation][TC]
that uses a [concurrent][CONC] [visual programming language][VPL].
Dissatisfied by the game's limit of three programs per level but excited
by its ability to export plain text, I have decided to place my
solutions into version control, which is absolutely a normal thing to
do.
